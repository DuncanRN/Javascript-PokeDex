# Description of Weekend Homework.

As weekend homework we were asked to use an API for the first time to import data. I found this API - 
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/
And got a little carried away. It includes next / previous pokemon buttons and a random pokemon button (the dice).

The most challenging part was dealing with some strange behaviour as we dug deeper into the api. This was caused by the asyncronous nature of fetch calls. 
We were taught how to useEffect() the very next day and all became clear!
